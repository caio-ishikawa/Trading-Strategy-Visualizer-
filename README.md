# Trading-Strategy-Visualizer-
At this current point, the program is only able to take in user input to create charts with 3 kinds of trading indicators (SMA, BBANDS and MACD).
The point of this project is to get more comfortable with Tkinter and manipulating pandas dataframes. 

# I want to add:
  - Buy and sell indicators for each strategy.
  - P/L tracking 
  - Strategy customization allowing user to change some parameters.
